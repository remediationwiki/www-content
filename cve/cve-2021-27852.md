title: "CVE-2021-27852"
description: "Checkbox Survey insecurely deserializes ASP.NET View State data"
vulnid: "706695"
draft: false
toc: true
vendors: ['Checkbox']

### Solution

#### Apply an update

Starting with Checkbox Survey 7.0, View State data is not used. Therefore, Checkbox Survey versions 7.0 and later do not contain this vulnerability.

#### Remove Checkbox Survey versions older than 7

Checkbox is no longer developing Checkbox Survey version 6, so this version is no longer safe to use. If you are unable to update to an unaffected version of Checkbox Survey, this software should be removed from any systems that have it installed.
