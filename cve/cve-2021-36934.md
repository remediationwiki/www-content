### Solution

Please see the [Microsoft bulletin for CVE-2021-36934](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-36934), which contains a workaround. Specifically:

#### Restrict access to %windir%\system32\config and remove VSS shadow copies

Vulnerable systems can enable ACL inheritance for files in the `%windir%\system32\config` directory by running the following command from an elevated prompt:
```
icacls %windir%\system32\config\*.* /inheritance:e
```

Once the ACLs have been corrected for these files, any VSS shadow copies of the system drive must be deleted to protect a system against exploitation. This can be accomplished with the following command:
```
vssadmin delete shadows /for=%systemdrive% /Quiet
```

Confirm that VSS shadow copies were deleted by running `vssadmin list shadows` again. Note that any capabilities relying on existing shadow copies, such as System Restore, will not function as expected. Newly-created shadow copies, which will contain the proper ACLs, will function as expected. Please see [KB5005357](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5005357-delete-volume-shadow-copies-1ceaa637-aaa3-4b58-a48b-baf72a2fa9e7) for more details.
